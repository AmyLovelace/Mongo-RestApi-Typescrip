Mongo-RestApi-Typescript

This repository is the outcome of following a tutorial to practice TypeScript. The tutorial used can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYWhyjy1IKc).

"You got the makings of greatness in you, but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course! Stick to it, no matter the squalls! And when the time comes, you'll get the chance to really test the cut of your sails and show what you're made of! And... well, I hope I'm there, catching some of the light coming off you that day."

thanks brother for showing me the way
